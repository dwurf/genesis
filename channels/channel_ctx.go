// FirstC selects the first available element from the given channels.
//
// The function returns in one of the following cases:
//
//  1. One of the given channels is closed. In this case,
//     [ErrClosed] is returned.
//  2. ‚èπÔ∏è The ctx context is canceled. In this case,
//     the cancelation reason is returned as an error.
//  3. One of the given channels returns a value. In this case,
//     the error is nil.
//
// If all channels are non-closed and empty and ctx is not canceled,
// the function will block and wait for one of the above to occur.
//
// If multiple messages are received at the same time,
// only one is chosen via a uniform pseudo-random selection (see below).
// Other messages will stay in their queues untocuhed.
//
// In no scenario any messages are lost. A message is either
// returned by a function or stays in the queue.
//
// # üò± Errors
//
//   - [ErrEmpty]: no channels are passed into the function.
//   - [ErrClosed]: a channel was closed.
//   - Another: cancelation cause returned by ctx.Err().
//
// # üçΩ What is starvation
//
// Imagine that you iterate through a list of channels and return an element
// from the first one that is available. Since the order of channels is always
// the same, if a value is always available in a multiple channels, you'll be
// selecting only from the first one. In other words, you never select from other
// channels as long as the first one always has a value for you. It might result
// in a situation when out of multiplt jobs you start only one is not blocked.
//
// This situation is called "[starvation]". To avoid that, the element in
// select statement, according to the [Go specification],
// "is chosen via a uniform pseudo-random selection".
//
// This function preserves that behavior by using internally
// a dynamically created (using [reflect]) select statement.
//
